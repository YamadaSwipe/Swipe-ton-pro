The previous AI engineer successfully initiated a full-stack React/FastAPI/MongoDB application. Their work trajectory shows a methodical approach, starting with environment setup, codebase exploration, and dependency installation. Key steps involved clarifying the matching feature requirements with the user, which was defined as a profile swiping mechanism (up for like, down for next). The engineer then implemented this core functionality by modifying both the FastAPI backend and React frontend components, specifically  and . The process included iterative user interaction for clarification and self-validation via screenshots. The current state is that the core matching logic is implemented, and the engineer is poised to begin testing the backend components before demonstrating the feature. The adherence to environment variables and specific URL/port configurations was strictly followed.

The user requires a career-tinder like application focusing on a matching feature. The core problem is enabling users to interact with profiles through a swiping mechanism to identify mutual interest. The explicit requirements for the matching functionality are:
1.  **Swipe Interaction:** Profiles should be displayed, and users can swipe:
    *   **Upward swipe:** Indicates a like for the profile.
    *   **Downward swipe:** Indicates next (skipping the current profile).
2.  **Profile Flow:** Profiles should scroll from the left.
3.  **Matching Logic:** A match occurs when two profiles reciprocally like each other (both swipe up on each other's profiles).
4.  **Verification:** The user initially asked for verification that the matching is active on the provided site.
5.  **Demonstration:** Upon completion, the user expects a link to view the implemented feature.
The implementation so far has focused on building this core swipe-based matching interface and backend logic.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack Architecture:** React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), MongoDB (database).
-   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS for UI.
-   **Deployment/Management:** Kubernetes (container environment), Supervisor (process manager).
-   **Data Handling:** Use of UUIDs for identifiers instead of MongoDB ObjectIDs.
-   **Configuration:** Strict adherence to environment variables (, ) for URLs/ports.

The application follows a standard full-stack structure:



**Detailed Directory Structure and Key Files:**

*   **/app/backend/**:
    *   : Lists Python dependencies for the FastAPI application.
    *   : The main FastAPI application file. This file is crucial as it hosts all backend API endpoints. It was modified to incorporate the logic for profile handling, swipe actions (like/next), and the core matching mechanism.
    *   : Stores environment variables specific to the backend, notably  for database connection.

*   **/app/frontend/**:
    *   : Manages Node.js dependencies and scripts for the React application.
    *   : Configuration for Tailwind CSS, defining design tokens and utility classes.
    *   : PostCSS configuration for CSS processing.
    *   : Stores frontend-specific environment variables, specifically  to communicate with the FastAPI backend.
    *   : Contains static assets like .
    *   : Contains the core React source code.
        *   : The entry point for the React application.
        *   : The main React component. This file was significantly modified to implement the user interface for displaying profiles and handling the swipe gestures (up for like, down for next).
        *   : Stylesheet for the  component. It was modified to support the visual aspects of the swiping interface, potentially including animations or layout for profiles.
        *   : Global styles for the application.

*   **/app/test_result.md**: This file serves as a crucial communication log and testing protocol. It contains the original problem statement, testing data, and records of previous agent interactions and test results. It is read and updated before and after testing phases.

<pending_tasks>
-   Perform backend testing for the new matching logic using .
-   Ask the user for permission to proceed with frontend testing after backend testing is complete.
-   Provide the final application link to the user once the feature is fully tested and verified.

<current_work>
The AI engineer has successfully implemented the core matching feature, which involves user profiles being swiped to indicate like (swipe up) or next (swipe down). This functionality spans both the backend and frontend.

On the backend,  was updated to handle the API endpoints for processing profile swipes and determining if a match occurs when two profiles like each other. While the specific code changes for  are not fully detailed in the trajectory, the Edit was successful messages and subsequent backend restarts confirm its modification. It is assumed that the backend now manages profile data, records swipe interactions, and identifies matches.

On the frontend, the user interface for swiping was implemented by modifying  and .  now contains the React components responsible for displaying profiles and capturing user swipe inputs.  provides the necessary styling for these components, ensuring the visual presentation aligns with the swiping interaction. The frontend is configured to communicate with the backend using the  environment variable, sending swipe actions to the API.

The application has reached a state where the basic swiping and matching mechanism is in place. The engineer has just completed these code modifications and performed necessary service restarts. The immediate next step is to begin the testing phase.
