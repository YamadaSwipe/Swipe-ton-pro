The previous AI engineer successfully developed a comprehensive frontend application, Swipe Ton Pro, a Tinder-like platform connecting individuals and professionals. The work followed a strict monolithic frontend approach using  and . Initially, the focus was on pixel-perfect visual replication and design elements like colors, typography, and page components, achieving an AHA moment through high-fidelity cloning.

Throughout the trajectory, the AI iteratively refined the UI, fixed parsing errors, and progressively implemented complex functionalities. Key areas of development included a robust authentication system with user roles (individual, professional, admin), full profile management, document upload and validation workflows for professionals (including a ghost mode), a simulated payment gateway, and a dynamic two-way swipe interface with custom animations. The project also addressed deployment inquiries and integrated an admin dashboard with user management and basic analytics. The work concluded with a partial implementation of multi-level admin invitation, left incomplete due to a parsing error.

<product_requirements>
The user requested an exact frontend replica of Swipe Ton Pro, a Tinder-like matchmaking site for individuals and professionals. The core problem was to create a visually identical clone with high-fidelity design, specific color palettes, typography, and page components (header, hero, profile card, process steps, advantages, trades grid, pricing plans, testimonials, mobile app, footer). Initially, all data was to be mocked.

Subsequent functional requirements expanded significantly:
-   **Core Platform**: Functional dashboards for individuals, professionals, and administrators.
-   **User Management**: Differentiated registration (individual/pro), persistent profile saving, full profile modification (including photo/avatar upload), password management.
-   **Professional Workflow**: Document upload for profile validation (24-48h processing time with ghost mode access), pack selection, and simulated payment.
-   **Swipe Interface**: Two-way swiping (pros swipe projects, individuals swipe pros), custom UX (profiles from right, swipe up to validate, down to refuse), and a homepage vitrine (showcase) of mixed profiles.
-   **Admin Features**: Admin dashboard for user and validation management, analytics, and site settings. A later request was to invite other administrators with different function levels.
-   **Content Refinements**: Iterative changes to images for trades (highly specific to profession), exact replication of pricing plan descriptions, and text adjustments for clarity and conciseness in key sections.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **React**: Primary framework for building the user interface.
-   **TailwindCSS**: Utilized for efficient and scalable styling.
-   **Framer Motion**: Integrated for advanced, fluid animations and interactions.
-   **localStorage**: Used for client-side data persistence, storing user profiles and authentication states.
-   ****: Tool employed to search for and select relevant images for the application.
-   ****: Leveraged for providing guidance on deployment and general inquiries.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a monolithic frontend architecture as per instructions, primarily leveraging two main JavaScript files within the  directory for its React components and logic.



-   
    -   **Summary of why this file is important**: Serves as the primary parent component for the entire application. It's responsible for orchestrating the overall structure, including routing different views (e.g., login, dashboard, homepage) based on user authentication status and role. It imports and renders the various components defined in .
    -   **Summary of the changes made to this file, if any**: Likely restructured to integrate the core application logic and components from , managing the top-level state and rendering different parts of the application based on the user's flow (e.g., pre-login, post-login, admin view).

-   
    -   **Summary of why this file is important**: This is the most crucial file in the codebase, containing the vast majority of the application's UI components, state management logic, and business rules. It houses everything from simple buttons and input fields to complex dashboards, profile management, swipe interfaces, and administrative panels. This file exemplifies the monolithic frontend file approach as specified in the prompt.
    -   **Summary of the changes made to this file, if any**: This file was under constant modification throughout the development process.
        -   **Initial Design Replication**: Implemented the entire visual design, including header, hero section, professional profile cards, how it works, why choose, trade categories, pricing plans, testimonials, and footer, adhering to specified colors, typography, and animations.
        -   **Styling & Content Adjustments**: Modified colors (orange to yellow), updated button texts, removed input fields, and repeatedly updated images for professional trades based on specific user feedback and  outputs. Text content in sections like sécurité garantie and interface de swipe révolutionnaire was refined for clarity and conciseness.
        -   **User Authentication & Authorization**: Implemented user registration (individual, professional), login, and -based session management. Admin login and role-based access were also integrated.
        -   **Dashboard & Profile Management**: Developed comprehensive dashboards for individuals, professionals, and administrators. This included features for users to modify personal and professional profiles, upload profile photos/avatars, and manage a bio.
        -   **Professional Workflow**: Integrated the ability for professionals to upload validation documents (Kbis, insurance, certifications) with a simulated 24-48 hour validation process, and an associated ghost mode for pending professionals.
        -   **Payment System**: Built a simulated payment flow for professional pack selection during registration, including a credit card form and billing address capture.
        -   **Swipe Interface**: Implemented the core Tinder-like swipe functionality with specific UX requirements: profiles animating from the right, swipe-up for validation, and swipe-down for refusal. It supports both individuals swiping professional profiles and professionals swiping project profiles.
        -   **Homepage Vitrine**: Created an automatic carousel on the homepage showcasing a mix of individual projects and professional profiles.
        -   **Admin Features**: Developed functionalities for the admin dashboard, including user listing, validation of pending professional profiles, basic analytics, and general site settings.
        -   **Email Integration**: Added  and  links in the footer.
        -   **Multi-Admin (Partial)**: Work began on implementing the ability for existing administrators to invite and manage other administrators with different access levels, but this was left incomplete due to a parsing error.

-   **Admin Role Management Implementation**: The feature allowing existing administrators to invite and manage other administrators with different function levels was initiated but not completed, ending with a parsing error.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively working on implementing the invite other administrators with levels of function feature within the admin dashboard. The last code modification was to  (Chat Message 218, 220, 222). This modification introduced a JavaScript parsing error:  (Chat Message 222). This error indicates that the code added for the multi-admin functionality contains a syntax mistake, likely a misplaced  statement, preventing successful compilation and operation of the frontend. The user's final instruction was to reprend ou tu es arreter (continue where you left off), signaling the immediate task is to debug and complete this specific feature. The current state is that the site's functionality related to this new admin feature is broken, and needs the parsing error resolved before it can be considered functional.

Fix the parsing error at line 4376 in  to complete the admin role management feature.
